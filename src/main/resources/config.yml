# Sometimes we can't cancel the metadata for sprinting as it's a bitmask used for other values too
# If the player turns invisible or is set on fire we still have to send the bitmask
# There are different types of fallback modes for this:
#   SERVER - this mode will just use the server sent value
#   SPRINT - always set sprinting true, causes the client to force the hit slowdown (if the client hit) for a single tick when it receives the updated metadata
#   NO_SPRINT - always set sprinting false, causes the client to not do the hit slowdown (if the client hit) even when its sprinting when it receives the updated metadata
mode: NO_SPRINT
